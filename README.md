# Elderly-fall-detection-using-computer-vision

Elderly fall detection using computer vision and machine learning is a promising technology aimed at improving the safety and independence of older adults living alone. Here's a breakdown of the key aspects:

Concept:

Cameras capture video footage of the living space.
Machine learning algorithms analyze the video to:
Detect a person's presence: Identify and track the individual within the frame.
Recognize posture and activity: Classify actions like standing, sitting, and potentially falling.
Distinguish falls from other activities: Differentiate between a fall and intentional actions like bending down or lying down.
Benefits:

Provides non-intrusive monitoring: Offers peace of mind without requiring the elderly to wear additional sensors.
Enables independent living: Allows seniors to maintain their independence while ensuring timely assistance in case of a fall.
Reduces healthcare costs: Early intervention after falls can prevent serious injuries and hospitalizations.

Technology breakdown:

Data Collection:
Videos of various activities, including falls, simulated by volunteers.
Diverse data capturing different lighting conditions, clothing styles, and backgrounds.

Preprocessing:
Background subtraction to isolate the person from the environment.
Image segmentation to identify body parts like head, torso, and limbs.

Feature Extraction:
Extracting key features from the image, such as body posture, limb angles, and motion patterns.

Machine Learning Model Training:
Training a machine learning model, often a deep learning algorithm, to recognize falls based on the extracted features.
The model learns to differentiate falls from other activities using labeled data.
